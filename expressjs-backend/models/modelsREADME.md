### Models
Models are used to define the structure of the data that will be stored in the database. The models are defined using the Mongoose library. The models are used to create the collections in the database. The models are also used to create the API endpoints that will be used to access the data in the database. The models are defined in the models folder. The models are exported to the routes folder where they are used to create the API endpoints. The models are also exported to the controllers folder where they are used to access the data in the database. The models are also exported to the tests folder where they are used to test the API endpoints.

Currently, in this simple app, the models are simply used along with services files in the same models folder that allows for the models to deal with any database interactions while the endpoints in backend.js can deal with network requests and responses; this separation of concerns makes the application modular and secure as well as making it easier to maintain and understand.
